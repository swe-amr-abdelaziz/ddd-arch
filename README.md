# Archward — DDD for TypeScript

Deterministic DDD + clean architecture conventions for TypeScript backends, enforced by ESLint. Framework-agnostic core. Opinionated by design: the rules remove architectural choices so a project's structure stays consistent — and machine-checkable — across teams and AI agents. Part of [Archward](https://github.com/archward) — the same standard, enforced across languages.

## Packages

| Package                   | Kind          | Purpose                                                     |
| ------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@archward/eslint-plugin` | devDependency | the `arch/*` rules + composed flat configs                  |
| `@archward/kernel`        | dependency    | framework-free DDD base classes the rules enforce           |
| `@archward/nestjs`        | dependency    | thin NestJS runtime bridges (event publisher, error filter) |
| `@archward/cli`           | devDependency | the `archward` CLI — scaffolds conformant files (ADRs, …)   |

## Roadmap

Each type ships as a bundle — **rule + test + doc** — and a matching **generator** (`@archward/cli`) co-developed with it. `✅` shipped · `⬜` planned · `—` not applicable.

Each layer also gets a **barrel** and an **allowed-imports** rule; adapters carry their own DTOs and mappers. Presentation holds **driving** adapters (they call a use-case); infrastructure holds **driven** adapters (they implement a port).

### Beyond the rules

- [x] Architecture preset (`configs.architecture`) — topology, dependency direction, default-deny
- [ ] Cross-context contracts — published language + integration events + consumer ACL
- [ ] `@archward/config` — one config shared by the linter and the generator
- [x] `@archward/cli` (`archward <element> <name>`, e.g. `archward adr "<title>"`) — ADR generator shipped with a generate → lint test; more elements co-developed per taxonomy
- [ ] `@archward/kernel` — `AggregateRoot`, `Entity`, `ValueObject`, `DomainEvent`, …
- [ ] `@archward/nestjs` — event publisher + error filter bridges
- [ ] Beyond TypeScript — the same standard in other languages (own organization)
